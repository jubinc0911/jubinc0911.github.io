## A Strict Teacher?

After my one-week experience with ESLint, my opinion about it is a very strict teacher. The ESLint always warns me with red underline that I am violating some ESLint standard. At first glance, it was very stressful and tedious because it never let me put more spaces between codes although I intentionally put it for a distinction. However, I believe that implementing such coding standard will eventually make my code look better and even improve my coding qualities. Like as every teacher wants their students to do well. 



## My Coding Helper

Implementing coding standard improves our coding skills and qualities. Although the coding standard might be very strict, it always prevents us to make some possible errors. Whenever I misspell a variable or function name, it always directly gives a warning for that. So, it can help me to prevent possible errors. Moreover, by implementing such coding standard, the quality of codes will be improved. For example, whenever a variable is not reassigned in the code, ESLint makes me to define that variable by const so that I can not change it accidently. Also, since such coding standard maintains consistency, my code looks organized and consistent. In this manner, the coding standards help us to prevent some errors and improve the quality of codes. 




## Having a Legible Handwriting

Implementing coding standard does not only improve the quality of codes, but also it improves the communication skills. When we take a look at someone else’s codes, it is often hard to understand what they wrote at a glance. That’s not because their codes have some problem, but because each person writes code differently as like handwriting.  For example, having an illegible handwriting for personal notes does not matter since no one else will look the notes. However, when we show our notes to someone else, having legible handwriting is very important. Similarly, in an individual project, implementing coding standard does not really matter. However, when people do some group projects, we must have a legible codes so that other people can easily understand. Implementing and following a coding standard might be very tedious and annoying. However, it will definitely improve the quality of the code and even communication skills.
