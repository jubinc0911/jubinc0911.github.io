## What led me to computer science?

Since young, I like to solve math problems, especially about logic puzzles. However, until I took my first computer science class in junior at high school, I was a person who very far away apart from coding or computer science. When I first take the computer science class, I got fascinated about it because it was all about logic puzzles, and I finally decided to become a computers scientist in the future since then. 

## Artificial Intelligence stole my interest!

After I got interested about computer science and programming, I did some research about branches in computer science. Among various kinds of it, there was a standout skill that make me possessed, which is artificial intelligence. There is a technology that takes my all interests about computer science, which is Autonomous Driving. Although it’s not completed technology yet, it fascinated me and make me to learn about artificial intelligence in the future.

## Dreaming about the future

Although my interests about artificial intelligence can be faded, I want to learn about artificial intelligence skills, such as machine learning and data analysis. So, I would like to take the relative courses in my near future, and I hope to get various experiences to develop my skill. I’m dreaming now that I engage in artificial development team, and I succeed to complete automatic driving with my team in the future.
